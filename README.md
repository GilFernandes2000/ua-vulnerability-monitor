# [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt) Vulnerability Monitor
## Abstract
The University of Aveiro suffers several cyber attacks weekly. To avoid possible intrusions into the system that could leave to denials of service, information theft and others, we have developed a platform that analyzes all exposed domains, performing a port-by-port assessment and presenting a classification of their exposure level, highlighting domains where vulnerabilities were found. This platform will periodically analyze these domains and, whenever any worrying failure is found, it will notify the user and the administrator to solve the problem.
